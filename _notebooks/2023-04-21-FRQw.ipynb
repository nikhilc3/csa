    "- **Type Safety:** Arrays make sure everything in them is the same kind. This stops mistakes and makes your program safer.\n",

    "The Math class in Java is like a toolbox for math. It has tools (methods and constants) for doing math stuff like adding, multiplying, finding square roots, and more. You don't have to go get it (import it) because it's already there when you start (part of the java.lang package). This toolbox is really handy because it can do complicated math without you having to figure out how, saving you time and making fewer mistakes.\n"
