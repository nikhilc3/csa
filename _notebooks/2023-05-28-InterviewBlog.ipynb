    "A project that really caught my attention was in the CSSE section. The project they made fascinated me and caught my attention, as to how begginers can. really work together and create something super interactive and fun. They made a Super Mario game that you could play with others at the same time. The game was fun to play, the controls were simple, and it looked great. Plus, there was a scoreboard where you could see how you did compared to your friends, which was really neat. It looked very well-made and was quite impressive. They were able to explain a little bit of how the code works but not too much, but it was an extremely well done project overall. Definitely looking to take the class after CSA, to keep on having coding in my high school classes.\n",
