    "### Improvements to bring up to 10\n",
    "  - The judges told us that our costumes were too hard to see, like the piece of papers representing the sorting and that is a very true point as it is a little hard to understand the sort without seeing the numbers which is a crucial part of it. \n",
    "  - Audience was jumbled up with too many things so probably kept it more clear and straight forward and concise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges:\n",
    "  - One big challenge was the time conflicting schedules, like one day I could not show up to practice as I was sick, although I had made it up by joining a call and catching up with Tirth and everyone\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Presentations/plays:\n",
    "  - Make demonstrations more visible\n",
    "  - Manage practices and time more effecient by giving days of notice and seeing if everyone is available\n",
    "  - More clarity in the speach \n",
    "  - Being more concise in a presentation is key not just in this but in anything"
