    "A Lot of my timings are extremely messed up like 14 minutes or even 5 seconds, since I did this on a road trip and the hotspot was extremely bad since we were on the mountains and the data gets cut off sometimes and then it would just kick me out of college board and also some of the times it would just not do anything on the screen for a while and not move to next question and freeze out and so I wrote down all my problems and steps just in case if something did not enter in due to internet. Also writing down steps really helped me process each and every step of the question to avoid silly mistakes and better thinking. I know you don't like paper but on the CB exam it really helps me think and not jumble too many things in my head which leads to errors and confusion. Also jsut for extra here are the picture of all my steps I did for every problem and it can kind of show how I thought through and did each question.\n",

I first started with the first iteration of the outer loop which resulted in 2 4 6 as those were the ones that had a remainder of 0 when divided by 2. Then for the second iteration of the outer loop, this resulted in 2 4 6 also since the inner loop is stil at 2. Then the third iteration resulted in 4 6 since the inner loop is on its 3rd iteration and so the numbers that are divisible by 2 without remainder are 4 and 6. Then same thing with outer iteration of 4. Then for outer iteration of 5, only numbers left that were divisible by 2 was 6 and this was same thing for outer iteration of 6."

    "This one was a little tricky as I had to read it carefully and think it through, I knew that math random generated a number 0 through 1 so you had to multiply by 6 in order to give us the range of 0-5. Then I knew we had to roll two number cubes and take the sum of them and int is needed which truncates the decimal. This right there eliminated A,B,D and only options left were C and E. Right now the range is 0-5 and a cubes range is not 0-5, it is 0-6 so to each cube you need to add 1, and since we are rolling two cubes you add 2 so the option was E. I really liked this since it was the fundamentals of math.random and it was kind of a breeze through elimination and once it came down to two options it was pretty easy. "

The way I approached it was basic logic of just plugging in false and true for each of the boolean variables with different combinations and then coming to the conclusion with the results that this was always false no matter what I put. Then once I looked at this explanation on CB, I saw we can use De Morgan's Law which I totally forgot about. \n",

So, when you put it together like `(x && y) && (!x && !y)`, it's clear it's always going to be false. It's like saying \"it's both day and night at the same time,\" which can't happen.

Then inside the for loop, it takes the number before every third index and adds it by three and then replaces that number with the index. So in this case, 34 gets replaced with the previous index (17) and 3 added to 17 which is 20. Then the third index value which is 15 gets replaced with the previous index (42) and adds 3 to get 45 and so on so forth untill the length of the array.

Basically how insertion sort is we put the 1st value as sorted which was 5, and looked at the next element to see if it was less than 5 and it was so place it before it. Now we know the 4 sorted so we look at 3 and compare it to 4 and 5 and we see that it is less than both 4 and 5 so we place it before 4 and so the values right now on the second step are 3,4,5,2,1 which is answer C. Recognizing this question or these type of questions where you do not even need to look at code and can complete question is extremely vital during the test as it can save you a lot of time.

Then the second iteration of the outer for loop, the x value is 1 right now and so the inner for loop iterates 3 times, 1,2,3 and adds one every time so 4+3 = 7. Second iteration of outer for loop, the count is 7. Now the third iteration of the for loop when the x value is 2, the inner for loop iterates 2 times with the y values of 2,3 and this produces an overall count of 9. Now on the fourth and final iteration of the outer for loop with x = 3, the inner for loop iterates once with y value of 3 and the count increases one last time to 9+1 = 10.

As soon as I read the problem I quickly looked at the code and identified the format very fast as this format was a selection sort and extremely similar to the one I coded in the mini project, just different variable names. Then I wrote down on my piece of paper and worked out the three passes of the selection sort. First you swap the smallest element (1) with the first element(6) in this case. Then second step find the samllest element in the unsorted list, numbers after 1, and the smallest element was 2 and then we swap the second element in the list with the smallest element from the unsorted list. Now you are at: 1,2,3,5,4,6. Then for the third step you do this again for the unsorted list (3,5,4,6), you find the smallest element in the unsorted list in this case which is 3 and swap with the third elemnt which is 3, so the list stays the same in this case. So after three passes, the values are 1,2,3,5,4,6 and this is option B. Doing the backend sorting calculations for the miniproject really helped me recognize the sorting extremely fast.

Then for the third iteration of value 2, it does not pass if statement so we go to next iteration of 3. In this row = 3,col=0, for the if statement, and x is placed, then going to the while loop, r=2,col=1 and r =1 and col=2 and r=0,col=3 and then for next iteration of outer for it is 4 which does not pass if statmenet so then loop terminates. So the values placed on the board are on r=1,col=0 amd r=0,col=1 and r=3,col=0 and r=2,col=1 and r =1,col=2 and r=0,col=3.

    "I do not think I was looking at the problem properly, it is obviously all three and not just 2 and 3. Basically 1 is correct since max is initially set to minimum value and basically as it iterates through the array, if there is a value that is greater than max, it replaces the max with the value and continues to do this untill it can not and this will provide the largest value in the array. I do not know or remember why I got this wrong, I think I was just not paying attention properly as I was doing this in the car but I should have gotten this correct, it was extremely simple. For these loops I did not need to write anything down but it usually is important to put down steps on pieces of paper as small errors or simple mistakes can occur, but in this problem it was not necessary."

    "This question on the CB test was probably my third favorite question as for the different methods we could do it. The way I did it at first was I saw that the equation to find out how many times the statement could execute was the total amount of elements(2000) divided by 2^n (2000/(2^n) = 1). This is because for every iteration to find the midpoint you would have to do the start + end/2. Now that we have the equation we can do some Calculas and logarithms, so we multiply both sides by 2^n and get 2^n = 2000. Now we log each side with a base of 2, so we have log base 2 of 2^n = log base 2 of 2000. Now we can cross out the log base 2 of 2 and we just have n = log base 2 of 2000. From here we get n = 11. There is another way to do it without calculus which is the way the College Board explanation did it, of keep dividng 2000 untill you get to 1 and then count how many times you were able to divide it, this way is probably easier to think about than the equation but would be slower. If we had a calculator on the exam, I would use the first method, but if we did not, then the second method is the way to go, as the calculations provide another layer of complexity, although since we are allowed to use a calculator on the APCSA, I went the route of the calculations."

    "For this one, I was pretty tired and was not focusing too well and was on a bumpy car and thats why I possibly made this mistake, but basically I thought that it first set every value to alex and then printed it out resulting in every value being Alex but that was wrong. Basically it first prints out Alex,Bob,Carl, while setting each one to alex, so it first prints out those names and then sets it to alex after each one printed, and now that they are set to alex, the next loop runs and it prints out the next three values Alex,Alex,Alex since the names are now set to Alex. So the resulting output would be:\n",
