    "## FRQ #1\n",
    "\n",
    "The FRQ from the AP CSA exam was about working with array and ArrayList structures to manipulate and analyze data. It focused on creating methods to sum array elements, check for the diversity of row sums in a two-dimensional array, and remove a specific column from a sparse array, updating the structure accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Person class from my project manages user-related data and can relate to the FRQ in ways like of handling collections of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@ManyToMany(fetch = EAGER)\n",
    "private Collection<PersonRole> roles = new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this snippet, roles is an ArrayList that manages PersonRole objects, demonstrating the concept of managing a collection of objects, which is similar to handling arrays and ArrayLists in the FRQ. Just like in the FRQ where you would check for the diversity of elements, in your project, you might need to ensure that each Person has a diverse set of roles, avoiding duplicates, and managing them efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my comment class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",

    "// Comment class snippet managing comment data\n",
    "@Entity\n",
    "public class Comment {\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    private Timestamp timestamp;\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the Comment class uses fields to represent structured data and this is similar how arrays are used in the FRQ to structure numerical data. The timestamp field for example can be compared to elements in an array that are being analyzed or manipulated showing object-oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## FRQ #2\n",
    "\n",
    "For FRQ #2 of the AP CSA exam, the task was to create a class that simulates a word guessing game where the player's guess results in hints. This class required methods to determine if a guessed letter was in the hidden word and in the correct location or just present in the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Comment class from my project that I coded also manages data like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` java\n",
    "\n",
    "@Entity\n",
    "public class Comment {\n",
    "\n",
    "    private String text;\n",

    "        return userName;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public String getGameName() {\n",
    "        return gameName;\n",
    "    }\n",

    "This class is to manage the comments of the users in the fantasy basketball page. It relates to the FRQ's focus on class creation and handling string data. In both the FRQ and my Comment class, the similarity is on manipulating string data—whether it’s for generating hints based on user input or storing and displaying user comments. In general, the skills applied in the FRQ directly translate to handling the Comment class in my project. The FRQ's getHint method and the class's getters and setters both are to process and provide access to the data that is in the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## FRQ #3\n",
    "\n",
    "I could not find any implementation of sparse arrays in my project but here is something we could have done to implement it in the section I coded, the comment section. Implementing a sparse array concept into my Comment class could be useful if I had a situation where I needed to manage a large number of comments meaning a lot of people using the website and chatting, but also expect many of them to be empty at any given time. For example, tracking comments across multiple games in a tournament, but not all games receive comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a regular 2D array that would put memory for all possible comment slots (some which might be empty), I could use a structure similar to a sparse array to store only the comments that exist. This would be much more memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Comment object would have the actual comment text and additional data like a timestamp or game name and have like an ArrayList or a HashMap that only stores these objects when a comment is made. When retrieving comments, the code could check for the existence of a comment by game name or timestamp, similar to checking for a non-zero value at a index in a sparse array.\n",
