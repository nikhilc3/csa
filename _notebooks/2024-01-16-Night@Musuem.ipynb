    "### Capturing Data:\n",
    "During demonstrations, we carefully listened to people's questions, noticed their difficulties, and what they liked. Based on this, we have identified the following points. Other than this people really enjoyed our presentation and I was even surprised at some parents who knew about aws servers and deployment and asks specifics of our code like our algorithm for the monte carlo's simulation to predict outcomes. Here are some feedback that I gathered :\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback from People:\n",
    "- Showing player details on the drafting page could improve the experience.\n",
    "- Some people were unsure who to choose or draft, so adding a feature that suggests recommendations might be helpful.\n",
    "- The method used to calculate team scores was confusing to some. Clarifying or demonstrating this process could be beneficial.\n",
    "- Some people also were a little confused on how to navigate the website to the stats page so maybe make the home page more interactive showing where everything is with different styling of arrows and things. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Implementation:\n",
    "- Explaining the scoring math more clearly is something we'll consider as quite a few people asked about it and we could explain but probably explaining it more clearly to them as they seemed a little confused.\n",
    "- Including player stats on the drafting page, or allowing team drafting through player search, could enhance the drafting process.\n",
    "- Future things we will do to keep working on the website are things like keep adding new data to our database and maybe more features like a fun game, not just a fantasy draft, but maybe a two player basketball game.\n",
    "- Making home page more interactive and easy for them to navigate. \n",

    "#### Areas for Improvement:\n",
    "- Our presentation consistency was lacking, leading to some features not being shown to everyone.\n",
    "- The project did not engage adults as much as expected. Making it more technical might capture their interest.\n",
    "- Some attendees disengaged during presentations. Having drafts selected by two people on separate screens might prevent this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Positive Aspects:\n",
    "- The project was especially appealing to teenagers and caught the attention of many.\n",
    "- Our presentation skills were strong, keeping the audience engaged throughout.\n",
    "- The project had an engaging hook and good planning, attracting many people to our presentation. Our team worked well together, with some members drawing in the crowd and others excelling at presenting.\n",

    "1. Something you saw in CompSci that impressed:\n",
    "A project that really caught my attention was in the CSSE section. The project they made fascinated me and caught my attention, as to how begginers can. really work together and create something super interactive and fun. They made a Super Mario game that you could play with others at the same time. The game was fun to play, the controls were simple, and it looked great. Plus, there was a scoreboard where you could see how you did compared to your friends, which was really neat. It looked very well-made and was quite impressive. They were able to explain a little bit of how the code works but not too much, but it was an extremely well done project overall. Definitely looking to take the class after CSA, to keep on having coding in my high school classes.\n",

    "I though tthis was very artistici as how they were able to draw this with such accuracy to a supercar. The trees in the background also add a good artistic effect, and the bushes in the background too. The car looks perfectly 3d like its standing on a road and it looks very visually appealing. Very good drawing overall. "
