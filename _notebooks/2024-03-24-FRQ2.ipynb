    "The FRQ required the crafting of a Java class, which was an engaging exercise in applying the fundamentals of Java programming. The task was to encapsulate the essential elements of a class, including instance variables, constructors, and the pivotal getHint method within the HiddenWord class but in this case making it into a basketball theme. The most intellectually stimulating part was devising the logic for the getHint method. This involved constructing conditional statements to compare the player's guess with the actual hidden word and return a string with asterisks, letters, and plus signs accordingly.\n",
