    "# Frontend Development for Cancer Research Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "Develop a frontend application that fetches data from a backend API containing statistics on the number of people affected by various types of cancer by country.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Outline:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "- Brief overview of the project.\n",
    "- Importance of visualizing cancer data for research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Setting up the Development Environment\n",
    "- Installing necessary tools and libraries.\n",
    "- Setting up a local development server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Designing the Frontend\n",
    "- Sketching a basic layout of the application.\n",
    "- Deciding on the UI/UX elements (charts, tables, filters, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Fetching Data from the Java APIâˆ‚\n",
    "- Making GET requests to fetch data.\n",
    "- Handling API responses and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Displaying the Data\n",
    "- Parsing the fetched data.\n",
    "- Using Java libraries to visualize the data (charts, graphs, etc.).\n",
    "- Implementing filters to view data by country or cancer type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Styling the Application\n",
