    "# Cancer Research Home Page\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Structure\n",
    "- The page is structured with a `navbar` at the top, followed by a `main` section.\n",
    "- The `navbar` contains a logo and a navigation menu with links to other pages.\n",
    "- The `main` section includes an introduction to the Cancer Research page and a data table that will be populated with cancer research data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Styles\n",
    "- The page uses a simple styling approach with a flexbox layout for the navbar and a centered main content area.\n",
    "- The color scheme revolves around a green (`#4CAF50`) for the navbar and table headers, with a light background for the body and main content area.\n",
    "- The table is styled to be fully width, with a border and padding for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## JavaScript\n",
    "- A script is included to fetch cancer research data from an API and display it in the table.\n",
    "- Another script provides functionality to filter the table based on user input in a search box.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interactive Body Diagram Page\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML Structure\n",
    "- The page has a title and a paragraph explaining the interaction with the body diagram.\n",
    "- The body diagram is an SVG element with various body parts and cancer types represented as circles.\n",
    "- There is an \"outside-box\" element to the right, which seems to be the target area for dragging the cancer circles.\n",
    "- A modal is included but initially set to display none; it will show more information when a cancer type is interacted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## JavaScript\n",
    "- The script allows for dragging and dropping of cancer circles into the \"outside-box\".\n",
    "- When a cancer circle is clicked or hovered over, it fetches data from an API and displays it in the modal.\n",
    "- The modal can be closed by clicking a button within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Functionality\n",
    "- The Cancer Research Home page is designed to provide users with data and information on various types of cancer.\n",
    "- The Interactive Body Diagram page is an educational tool that allows users to interact with a diagram of the human body, learning about different cancers by dragging representations to a designated area and viewing more information in a modal.\n",

    "## Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "The JavaScript code provided in the project is a good example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles applied in a scripting language context. OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the core principles of OOP, which means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from the view outside the objectâ€™s definition. In the provided code, encapsulation is demonstrated through the use of functions that manipulate data internally. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `fetchData` function encapsulates the logic for fetching data from an API.\n",
    "- The `displayData` function encapsulates the logic for displaying the fetched data in the table.\n",
    "- The `searchTable` function encapsulates the logic for searching through the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functions hides the details of its implementation from the outside scope, providing a clear interface for interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity refers to the concept of making multiple modules first and then linking and combining them to form a complete system. The code shows modularity by separating concerns into functions and event listeners, which can be maintained independently of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event listeners are used to handle user interactions, such as clicks and key presses.\n",
    "- DOM manipulation is handled in its own set of functions, separate from data fetching and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability is a significant advantage of OOP, allowing developers to reuse and recycle code. In the project code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `fetchData` function can be reused for different endpoints or modified for different types of data retrieval.\n",
    "- The `displayData` function can be reused to display different kinds of data structures that follow the same format.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Java Backend Development Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This trimester, I focused on developing a RESTful API using Java with the Spring Boot framework. The project involved creating a comprehensive backend system for managing cancer data, which included CRUD operations for cancer records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Management:** I learned how to interact with a JPA repository to perform database operations, which was crucial for managing the cancer data records.\n",
    "- **API Design:** I developed skills in designing API endpoints that are intuitive and REST-compliant, ensuring that the frontend could easily interact with the backend.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** I implemented proper error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes, which improved the reliability of the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CORS Configuration:** Understanding and implementing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) was initially a hurdle but was essential for the frontend to communicate with the backend. I had a really big cors error and it was extremely hard to fix but I did fix it after a lot of research. The error was I needed to add a corsconfig file and add a cors line to every single controller java in the backend. \n",
    "\n",
    "## JavaScript Frontend Development Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the frontend, I worked with JavaScript to create an interactive body diagram that allows users to learn about different types of cancers.\n",
    "- I also did a fetch from the backend databse to display the main datatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DOM Manipulation:** I became proficient in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to create dynamic and interactive user experiences.\n",
    "- **Event Handling:** I learned to handle various events such as clicks, mouse movements, and drags, which was pivotal for the interactive aspect of the body diagram.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** I used `fetch` API for asynchronous data retrieval from the backend, which was essential for displaying cancer-related data.\n",
    "- **Backend**: Learned how to work with Backend API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SVG Interaction:** Working with SVG elements to create interactive diagrams was initially complex, especially when making them responsive to user actions.\n",
    "- **UI/UX Design:** Ensuring that the user interface was intuitive and user-friendly required careful design and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Reflection\n",
